            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The Green Florist </p>
            
            <p>Flowers are given to loved ones for almost any occasion. At The Green Florist, we wanted to take a more sustainable approach to that tradition. Whether for others or for your own home, we create arrangements with dried florals and greenery. This way, they last longer and become a permanent part of your life. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>This company serves those who enjoy brightening their home with flowers, but don't want to spend extra money to constantly replace the old, dead ones. Or for individuals who want to give a thoughtful gift to loved ones who live far away. The Green Florist is also for those who want to send the gift of flowers, but flowers that will last forever.</p>
