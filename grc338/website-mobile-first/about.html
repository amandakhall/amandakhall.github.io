                <h2>Welcome to Sunshine Cafe!</h2>
                    <p>Sunshine Cafe opened back in August 2013, and have been serving coffee everyday since! With only three locations located across California, we value our small business as being dedicated to our community. With either a view of the ocean, mountains, or trees, we hope our coffee and other items brings a little sunshine to your day. </p>
